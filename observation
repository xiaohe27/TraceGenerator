Even we use the same program and property,
we cannot guarantee the same effects.
Because hashCode of the same obj may be different 
at different runs. 

Using multiple threads and random good/bad patterns
will also make it more unpredictable.

So the number of events for each type may vary 
from run to run.

I can make the number of events eq to the required stats though.
